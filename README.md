# Static Code Analyser for Python files
JetBrains static-code-analyser-python

The program accepts either path to python script or path to the folder with multiple python scripts.

## Functionality:

- Checks yor code style.
- Checks that all the names of function arguments as well as local variables meet the requirements of PEP8 using Abstract Syntactic Tree. 
- Checks that the given code does not use mutable values (lists, dictionaries, and sets) as default arguments to avoid errors in the program.
* Does not force the names of variables outside of functions (for example, in modules or classes).
